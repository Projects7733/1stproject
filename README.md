## 🤔 What is Three-tire architecture

Three-tier architecture is mostly used method for deploying your web application in the cloud. In this the architecture is divided into three layers.

🔸Presentation layer ➡️ handles user interaction
🔸Application layer(backend logic) ➡️ processes business logic and data processing
🔸Database layer (database) ➡️ manages data storage and retrieval

Each layer has its responsibilities,allowing for scalability,maitainability,modularity.By dividing the architecture into separate layers we can gain security easy updates without impacting others.
